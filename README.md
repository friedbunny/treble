## Getting started

Treble is still extremely rough and development continues apace. If you want to try it out now, hereâ€™s what to do:

1. `git clone https://github.com/friedbunny/treble.git`
1. `cd treble && pod install`
1. Open `Treble.xcworkspace` in Xcode and build it for your device or simulator

## Known problems

* Apple MapKit does not sync zoom with Mapbox or Google
* Bearing/heading does not sync
