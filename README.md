Treble is still extremely rough and development continues sporadically. If you want to try it out now, hereâ€™s what to do:

1. `git clone https://github.com/friedbunny/treble.git`
1. `cd treble && pod install`
1. `cp treble/APIKeys.EXAMPLE.plist treble/APIKeys.plist`
1. Add your [Mapbox access token](https://www.mapbox.com/help/create-api-access-token/) and [Google API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/get-api-key) to `APIKeys.plist`
1. Open `Treble.xcworkspace` in Xcode and build it for your device or simulator
